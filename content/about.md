Hi, my name is [**Muhamad Fajar**](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fajar)**,** a software engineer from **Indonesia**. I currently work as a tech lead for [GoTix](https://go-tix.id) at [Lokét](https://loket.com), previously venturing at [SoftwareSeni](https://softwareseni.com) and [Talenesia](https://talenesia.com). In my daily –developer-activity– I'm using **_Go_**, **_Python_**, **_Ruby_** or other.

Since the beginning of my journey as a full-stack engineer so many years ago, I've done remote work for companies and collaborated with a team to create products for both business and consumer use. I have been lucky enough to work with incredibly talented people.

If you should desire to contact me, you can reach me using **_hi_** at **_this domain_**.
