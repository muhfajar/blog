## Part one, me as who owns this website

Hello! I'm **Muhamad Fajar**, a software engineer from Indonesia. I currently work as a tech lead for _GoTix_ at _Lokét_, previously venturing at _SoftwareSeni_ and _Talenesia_. On my daily --developer-activity-- I'm using Go, Python, Ruby or other.

### Tales of Programing Language

**-- _Python_; Accidentally in Love --** I knew _Python_ not because 

**-- The journey with _Ruby_ --** I began to know _Ruby_ when I started working at _Lokét_. From that day I have only 3 days before my very first task using _Ruby_ itself. The first task is creating API for deep-linking event categorized, fortunately with very limited knowledge about _Ruby_ and never touched that language before, thank God, I'm not breaking the legacy code.

The journey began when I need something fast; fast in development and also fast in processing external API. I'm using Go relatively still very new, but so far so good, I can easily understand using this programing language.

I also love using _Django_. This framework is like my deadline friend,
almost all side project what I was done is using Django, when I only
have limited time in a weekend, I need something that I can count on
and Django is the answer. Using this framework I can cut off timeline
from 3 months of work to only 1 month.

I also contribute to open source project, mostly contribution because I'm
using that lib/app but getting error when compile or running and also adding
new localization.
