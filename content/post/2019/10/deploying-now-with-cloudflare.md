*This post has been updated with the latest update from Vercel (formerly ZEIT)

I've been playing around with [Now][vercel] deployment for a few months. First I thought about Now is magic, with only small configuration (in v2) I can deploy a static website easily and with the latest update, now I can deploy (with default template) any static website without any configuration. That's amazing.

## How to Deploy

First thing, you need Vercel account, of course. Next, if you use one of the templates from this [list][template], congratulation, you only need execute `now` from the project root, something like this.

```bash
cd my_project
now
```

That's it. For the rest let Now do the work.

After your project has been deployed, you will be provided with a link to the Preview Deployment, this can be shared **immediately**.

## How to Use Cloudflare with Now

Vercel have internal domain management, so you can directly buy domain inside Vercel dashboard. But if you want to set up domain setting using [Cloudflare][cloudflare] so you can set cache or other, this also simple. You just need register some DNS and encryption settings.

### Add DNS Records

To connecting Cloudflare with Vercel, you need add `CNAME` record with alias of `alias.zeit.co` so its traffic proxied through Cloudflare. Next, register domain to Vercel account using

```bash
now domains add your-domain-name.com
```

when add the domain success, you will get a verification code for further to fill `TXT` record with name `_now`.

After all records has been created, you need to verify domain using
```bash
now domains verify your-domain-name.com
```

### Make HTTPS Works

To make https works you need change Cloudflareâ€™s encryption mode to **Full (strict)** and then create page rules to make Enforce HTTPS for this domain:
1.  Go to page "Create Page Rule"
2.  Add new page rules with configuration like this:\
    URL: __http://\*your-domain-name.com/\*__ \
    The settings are: **Always Use HTTPS**
3.  Save and Deploy

## Make Deploy Automatically

If your project source code hosted on [GitHub][github], [GitLab][gitlab] or [Bitbucket][bitbucket], Vercel have tools to integrating with deployment, so when you push code to the specific branch, Vercel will automatically detect changes and make a deployment. For more information,jump up to [Vercel documentation][doc].

End of word, yes, I'm using Now in my [personal website landing][fajar]. Next: [Purge Cache with Git Hooks][cache].
